`README.md` for wim: wic Image Manipulator

## What is wim? ##

wim is a tool that allows users to perform post-build manipulation of an
OpenEmbedded-generated wic image file without needing root privileges.

wic is a tool that is used by OpenEmbedded to lay out build artifacts into
a file under the direction of a wks configuration. In most cases the result
is an image that is bootable on some target device (although this is not
strictly the case; a wks configuration could lay out pieces of a wic file
that is not necessarily an image that is bootable).

If a wic file contains a bootable image, that image will start with some
flavour of a partition table, then contain one or more partitions. Two
common partition table formats are GPT and MBR, with GPT being the newer of
the two. Partitions can be formatted in one of many formats such as vfat,
ext2/3/4, btrfs, etc. Currently wim supports both GPT and MBR partition
tables, and only supports vfat and ext2/3/4 partition formats.

If a wic file contains a bootable image, the wim tool allows you to:
- list the partition information
- list the contents of a directory of a partition in the wic
- copy files to/from the host machine from/to a partition in the wic
- remove files from a partition in the wic

NOTE: if a bmap file was generated by the OE/Yocto build alongside the wic
      file it generated, that bmap file will be invalidated by any post-build
      modifications to the wic
